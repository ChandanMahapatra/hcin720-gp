### The ambient display

This device is an ambient display that can help people to remember to go to the theatres more often. It projects an image thats resembles a genre, so that people might get interested in going to the theatre after looking at the display. We wanted the design to look like a toy projector (viewfinder) and closely resemble the green one-eyed "monster" from Monster Inc. The reason for this was, we wanted our device to be approachable and fun for everyone in the house. We also wanted the device to be used as a fun display piece.

#### Working
It projects an image that resembles a genre for a movie that is coming up next (within 20mins).
A neopixel is attached to the photon for the projection. The reel has been rastered for the image projection. We have used a servo motor for rotating the reel to the genre of the movie.

We used the onconnect service from Gracenote that provides local movie show timings based on zipcode.

#### Fabric
Fabric is used as the main display and the movie genre is projected on it.
